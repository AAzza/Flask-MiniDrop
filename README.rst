Flask-MiniDrop
______________

This is trivial wrapper around creation of DropboxAPI client just to simplify configuration.
Its aim is to perform connection to predefined dropbox account with already obtained
access_token.

It's toy extension and possibly not you are looking for. There is cool
Flask extension for Dropbox, which supports all required features.
For example: https://github.com/playpauseandstop/Flask-Dropbox
